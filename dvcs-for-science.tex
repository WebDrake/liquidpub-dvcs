\title{Distributed version control for credit and collaboration in science}
\begin{abstract}
We investigate the question of how scientific research can become more openly
collaborative, in the sharing spirit of free and open source software.  In
particular we examine how distributed version control tools can be used to
manage an open community of researchers who, while sharing common research
goals, may differ strongly in their interpretation of results or their ideas
about the most productive lines of investigation.  At the same time, we examine
the question of how credit can be meaningfully assigned to contributors---credit
for concrete contributions of results or writing, for ideas, and for
organisational work such as project maintenance.  This article is itself being
developed in a collaborative DVCS system with open contributions solicited.  The
experience of contributors in working on the article will feed its own results
and conclusions.
